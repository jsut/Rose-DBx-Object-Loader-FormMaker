NAME
    Rose::DB::Object::Loader::FormMaker - Automatically create RHTMLO forms
    for RDBO Objects

VERSION
    version 0.01

  make_modules
        see the documentation for Rose::DB::Object::Loader for the bulk of
        the configuration options for make_modules. FormMaker adds a single
        element to that called form_prefix, which is the prefix you want on
        your form classes. Very much the same as class_prefix in
        RDBO::Loader

  class_to_form
        class_to_form takes an RDBO class, and using it's meta information
        constructs an RHTMLO Form object.

  form_prefix
    form_prefix is just for the initialization of the form_prefix option to
    FormMaker
