NAME
    Rose::DB::Object::Loader::FormMaker - Automatically create RHTMLO forms
    for RDBO Objects

VERSION
    version 0.01

  make_modules [PARAMS]
    see the documentation for Rose::DB::Object::Loader for the bulk of the
    configuration options for make_modules. FormMaker adds a couple of
    options to what Loader provides described below:

    form_prefix [PREFIX]
        The prefix used for Form classes created by FormMaker. Basically the
        same thing as class_prefix provided by loader. It must not be the
        same as class_prefix or Bad Things will happen.

    form_base_classes [ CLASS | ARRAYREF ]
        The same as base_classes, but for Forms. Defaults to
        'Rose::HTML::Form'.

    base_tabindex [ SCALAR ]
        The lowest tabindex that should be used for form elements in the
        created forms. Defaults to 1.

  class_to_form
        class_to_form takes an RDBO class, and using it's meta information
        constructs an RHTMLO Form object.

  form_prefix
    form_prefix is just for the initialization of the form_prefix option to
    FormMaker

  form_base_classes
    get/set the base class(es) for the Form objects
